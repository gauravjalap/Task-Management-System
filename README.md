# Task-Management-System

## Some configure should be made before starting the project:

- Get your MongoDB Connection String, keep it handy.
  Now go to `server` directory and make a `config.env` file and put
  `DATABASE="your_connection_string"`
&nbsp 
  `SECRET_KEY="your_secret_key_for_jwt"`

- Install all package in `client` and `server` folder by `npm install`
- Now run the project and Enjoy..
